# SEO Settings Configuration

## Favicon Configuration

Instead of hardcoding favicon requests in the code, please configure your website's SEO settings through the proper channels:

### How to Configure Favicons:

1. Navigate to **Project Detail → Settings → SEO**
2. Upload your favicon files (recommended formats: .ico, .png, .svg)
3. Configure the following favicon sizes:
   - 16x16 pixels
   - 32x32 pixels  
   - 180x180 pixels (Apple touch icon)
   - 192x192 pixels (Android icon)
   - 512x512 pixels (High-res Android icon)

### Current Implementation:

The website currently uses `/logo.png` as a fallback favicon. To customize this:

1. Replace `/public/logo.png` with your custom favicon
2. Or better yet, use the Project Settings → SEO configuration panel
3. Ensure your favicon follows best practices:
   - Use .ico format for broad compatibility
   - Include multiple sizes for different devices
   - Optimize file size for faster loading

### Benefits of Proper Favicon Configuration:

- ✅ Better browser compatibility
- ✅ Improved loading performance
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Enhanced user experience
- ✅ Better SEO rankings

### Troubleshooting:

If you see 404 errors for favicon files:
- Check that the favicon files exist in the `/public/` directory
- Clear browser cache after updating favicons
- Use the SEO settings panel instead of manual file placement
