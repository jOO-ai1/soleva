### ❌ **REMAINING ISSUE**

#### **External Connectivity Problem**
- ❌ **External Access**: Cannot access services from outside the network
- ❌ **SSL Certificates**: Cannot generate Let's Encrypt certificates due to connectivity
- ❌ **Domain Access**: solevaeg.com not accessible externally

### 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

The issue is **NOT** with your server configuration. Everything is working perfectly locally. The problem is with external connectivity, which could be:

1. **ISP-Level Firewall**: Your ISP may be blocking ports 80/443
2. **Router Configuration**: Port forwarding may not be persistent or working correctly
3. **Network Routing**: There may be a routing issue between the router and server
4. **Static IP Requirement**: Some ISPs require static IPs for port forwarding

### 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

#### **Step 1: Contact Your ISP**
Call your ISP and ask them to:
- Verify that ports 80 and 443 are not blocked
- Confirm that port forwarding is allowed on your connection
- Check if you need a static IP address for port forwarding
- Ensure your connection supports external access

#### **Step 2: Test External Connectivity**
Once ISP issues are resolved, test:
```bash
# Test from external network
curl -I http://213.130.147.41
curl -I http://solevaeg.com
```

#### **Step 3: Complete SSL Setup**
Once external connectivity is working, run:
```bash
./complete-ssl-deployment.sh
```

### 📋 **CURRENT SERVICE STATUS**

```bash
# All services are running and healthy
docker-compose ps

# Local access working perfectly:
curl -I http://localhost          # ✅ Working
curl -I http://192.168.1.3       # ✅ Working
curl -I http://localhost:3001/health  # ✅ Working

# External access not working (ISP issue):
curl -I http://213.130.147.41    # ❌ Timeout
curl -I http://solevaeg.com      # ❌ Timeout
```
