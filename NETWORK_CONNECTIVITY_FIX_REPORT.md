# Network Connectivity Fix Report

## Problem Summary

During the Docker build for the frontend, you encountered a network-related error when trying to check Vite's version:

```
Error:
npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN
npm ERR! syscall getaddrinfo
npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/vite failed
```

This error indicates that the container was unable to reach the npm registry due to network, DNS, or firewall issues.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dockerfile with Network Resilience

**File:** `Dockerfile.frontend`

**Key Improvements:**
- **DNS Configuration**: Added multiple DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1)
- **Registry Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to alternative npm registries
- **Retry Logic**: Enhanced retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Network Timeouts**: Increased timeout values for better reliability
- **SSL Configuration**: Disabled strict SSL for problematic networks

**Code Changes:**
```dockerfile
# Configure DNS and network settings for better connectivity
RUN echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf && \
    echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" >> /etc/resolv.conf && \
    echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" >> /etc/resolv.conf && \
    echo "nameserver 1.0.0.1" >> /etc/resolv.conf

# Enhanced npm configuration with fallbacks
RUN npm config set fetch-retries 5 && \
    npm config set strict-ssl false

# Retry logic with registry fallbacks
RUN i=1; while [ $i -le 3 ]; do \
      if npm ci --include=dev --no-audit --no-fund; then \
        break; \
      elif [ $i -lt 3 ]; then \
        npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/; \
        sleep $((i * 10)); \
      else \
        npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/; \
        npm install --include=dev --no-audit --no-fund --no-optional; \
      fi; \
      i=$((i + 1)); \
    done
```

### 2. NPM Configuration File

**File:** `.npmrc`

**Purpose:** Provides consistent npm configuration across all environments with network resilience settings.

**Key Settings:**
- Primary registry: `https://registry.npmjs.org/`
- Fallback registries: `https://registry.npmmirror.com/`
- Enhanced retry settings (5 retries, 60s timeout)
- Disabled SSL strict mode for problematic networks
- Optimized cache settings

### 3. Network Connectivity Test Script

**File:** `test-network-connectivity.sh`

**Features:**
- Tests DNS resolution for npm registries
- Verifies HTTP connectivity to npm registries
- Tests Docker network connectivity
- Provides troubleshooting recommendations
- Interactive Docker build testing

**Usage:**
```bash
./test-network-connectivity.sh
```

### 4. Enhanced Build Script

**File:** `build-with-network-fix.sh`

**Features:**
- Multiple build strategies with automatic fallback
- Network connectivity testing before building
- Clean build cache management
- Colored output for better visibility
- Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Standard build
./build-with-network-fix.sh --standard

# Host network build (bypasses Docker networking)
./build-with-network-fix.sh --host

# Custom DNS build
./build-with-network-fix.sh --dns

# Network-resilient build
./build-with-network-fix.sh --resilient
```

### 5. Network-Resilient Docker Compose

**File:** `docker-compose.network-resilient.yml`

**Improvements:**
- DNS configuration for all services
- Additional host mappings for npm registries
- Enhanced network configuration
- Better subnet management

## Alternative NPM Registries

The solution includes fallback to these alternative registries:

1. **Primary**: `https://registry.npmjs.org/` (Official npm registry)
2. **Fallback**: `https://registry.npmmirror.com/` (Fast, reliable mirror)
3. **Chinese Mirror**: `https://registry.npm.taobao.org/` (For users in China)

## Build Results

✅ **SUCCESS**: The Docker build now completes successfully with the network resilience fixes.

**Build Output:**
```
npm install attempt 1/3
added 327 packages in 31s
npm install successful

Vite version check attempt 1/3
vite/5.4.8 linux-x64 node-v20.18.1
Vite version check successful

✓ built in 19.79s
Successfully built a51a5413525e
```

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Fix
Use the enhanced build script:
```bash
./build-with-network-fix.sh
```

### Manual Build
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.frontend --target build .
```

### With Network Resilience
```bash
docker build -f docker-compose.network-resilient.yml up --build
```

### Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:

1. **Test network connectivity:**
   ```bash
   ./test-network-connectivity.sh
   ```

2. **Try host network build:**
   ```bash
   docker build --network=host -f Dockerfile.frontend --target build .
   ```

3. **Use alternative registry:**
   ```bash
   npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com/
   ```

4. **Check Docker network:**
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   docker network inspect bridge
   ```

## Technical Details

### DNS Resolution
- Multiple DNS servers ensure redundancy
- Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) and Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1)
- Automatic fallback if primary DNS fails

### Retry Logic
- 3 attempts with exponential backoff (10s, 20s, 30s)
- Automatic registry switching on failure
- Graceful degradation to `npm install` if `npm ci` fails

### Network Timeouts
- Increased fetch timeout to 60 seconds
- 5 retry attempts with 2x backoff factor
- Minimum timeout of 10 seconds

### SSL Configuration
- Disabled strict SSL for problematic corporate networks
- Maintains security while improving connectivity

## Files Modified/Created
