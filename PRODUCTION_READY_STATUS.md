Call your ISP and request:
- Unblock ports 80 and 443
- Verify port forwarding is allowed
- Check if static IP is required

#### **Step 2: Complete SSL Setup**
Once external connectivity is working:
```bash
./complete-ssl-deployment.sh
```

#### **Step 3: Go Live!**
Your e-commerce platform will be fully operational!
