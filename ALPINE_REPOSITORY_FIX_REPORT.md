# Alpine Linux Repository Connectivity Fix Report

## Issue Summary
The production deployment was failing due to two main issues:
1. **Alpine Linux Repository Connectivity**: Temporary connectivity issues with Alpine Linux package repositories during `curl` installation
2. **NPM Timeout Issues**: NPM package installation was timing out with "Exit handler never called!" errors

## Root Cause
- Alpine Linux package repositories (`dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org`) were temporarily unavailable
- The Docker build process failed with exit code 4 during `apk update`
- NPM was timing out during package installation due to network issues and large dependency trees
- This affected all services: backend, frontend, and admin panel

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dockerfiles with Retry Logic
Updated all three Dockerfiles to include robust retry mechanisms for both Alpine packages and NPM:

#### NPM Configuration
Added comprehensive npm configuration for better reliability:
```dockerfile
# Configure npm for better reliability
RUN npm config set fetch-retry-mintimeout 20000 && \
    npm config set fetch-retry-maxtimeout 120000 && \
    npm config set fetch-retries 5 && \
    npm config set fetch-retry-factor 2 && \
    npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

#### NPM Retry Logic
```dockerfile
# Install dependencies with retry logic
RUN for i in 1 2 3; do \
        npm ci --omit=dev && npm cache clean --force && \
        break || \
        (echo "npm install attempt $i failed, retrying..." && sleep 10); \
    done
```

#### Backend Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile`)
```dockerfile
# Install curl with retry logic and alternative repositories
RUN for i in 1 2 3; do \
        apk update --no-cache && \
        apk add --no-cache curl && \
        break || \
        (echo "Attempt $i failed, retrying..." && sleep 5); \
    done || \
    (echo "Using alternative repository..." && \
     sed -i 's/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/mirror.yandex.ru\/mirrors\/alpine/g' /etc/apk/repositories && \
     apk update --no-cache && \
     apk add --no-cache curl)
```

#### Frontend Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.frontend`)
- Applied the same retry logic pattern
- Uses Yandex mirror as fallback repository

#### Admin Dockerfile (`admin/Dockerfile`)
- Applied the same retry logic pattern
- Uses Yandex mirror as fallback repository

### 2. Enhanced Deployment Script
Updated `deploy.sh` to include retry logic for the entire build process:

```bash
# Build with retry logic for network issues
local max_attempts=3
local attempt=1

while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do
    log_info "Build attempt $attempt/$max_attempts..."
    
    if $COMPOSE_CMD -f "$SCRIPT_DIR/docker-compose.prod.yml" build --no-cache --parallel; then
        log_success "All images built successfully"
        return 0
    else
        log_warning "Build attempt $attempt failed"
        if [ $attempt -lt $max_attempts ]; then
            log_info "Waiting 30 seconds before retry..."
            sleep 30
        fi
    fi
    
    attempt=$((attempt + 1))
done
```

### 3. Test Script
Created `test-docker-build.sh` to verify the fixes work before running the full deployment.

## Key Improvements

1. **Alpine Package Retry Logic**: Each `apk` command now retries up to 3 times with 5-second delays
2. **Alternative Repository**: Falls back to Yandex mirror if primary repository fails
3. **NPM Configuration**: Enhanced timeout settings and retry parameters for npm
4. **NPM Retry Logic**: Each `npm ci` command retries up to 3 times with 10-second delays
5. **Build Retry**: Entire Docker build process retries up to 3 times with 30-second delays
6. **Better Logging**: Enhanced error messages and progress indicators
7. **Test Validation**: Pre-deployment test script to verify builds work

## Files Modified

- `backend/Dockerfile` - Added retry logic for curl installation and npm configuration
- `Dockerfile.frontend` - Added retry logic for curl installation and npm configuration
- `admin/Dockerfile` - Added retry logic for curl installation and npm configuration
- `deploy.sh` - Added build retry logic
- `test-docker-build.sh` - Enhanced test script with retry logic (updated)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Individual Builds**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker-build.sh
   ```

2. **Run Full Deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

## Expected Behavior

- **Alpine Packages**: If primary repository is available, builds proceed normally. If it fails, automatically retries with delays and switches to alternative Yandex mirror
- **NPM Packages**: Enhanced timeout settings and retry logic handle network issues during package installation
- **Build Process**: If individual service builds fail, entire deployment retries up to 3 times with 30-second delays
- **Test Script**: Individual service builds retry up to 2 times with 30-second delays

## Benefits

- **Resilience**: Handles temporary network issues gracefully
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure builds succeed
- **Transparency**: Clear logging shows what's happening during failures
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add more alternative repositories if needed

## Future Considerations

- Monitor Alpine repository availability
- Consider adding more alternative mirrors (e.g., mirrors in different regions)
- Implement health checks for repository availability
- Consider using multi-stage builds with cached base images
