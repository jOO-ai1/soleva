# Network Connectivity Fix for Soleva Deployment

## Problem Description

The deployment was failing due to DNS resolution issues during Docker builds. The error messages showed:

```
Temporary failure resolving 'deb.debian.org'
```

This indicates that Docker containers cannot reach the Debian package repositories during the build process, causing package installation failures.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **DNS Resolution Issues**: The Docker build process cannot resolve domain names for package repositories
2. **Network Connectivity Problems**: Intermittent connectivity to external package repositories
3. **Single DNS Server Dependency**: Reliance on a single DNS server that may be unreliable
4. **No Retry Logic**: Package installation failures don't have retry mechanisms

## Solution Overview

I've created a comprehensive solution that addresses these issues through:

### 1. Network-Resilient Deployment Script (`deploy-with-network-fallback.sh`)

**Features:**
- **Multiple DNS Servers**: Uses 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4, 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 for redundancy
- **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff for package installations
- **Network Testing**: Pre-deployment connectivity and DNS resolution tests
- **Enhanced Dockerfiles**: Custom Dockerfiles with built-in network resilience
- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Network-optimized service definitions

**Key Improvements:**
- Package installation retry with up to 5 attempts
- Multiple DNS server configuration in containers
- Enhanced npm configuration for better reliability
- Network connectivity pre-checks

### 2. Network Diagnostic and Fix Script (`fix-network-connectivity.sh`)

**Features:**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests basic connectivity, DNS resolution, and package repositories
- **Automatic Fixes**: Configures DNS, restarts network services, and optimizes Docker
- **Docker Build Testing**: Validates that Docker builds work with the fixes
- **System Configuration**: Updates system DNS and Docker daemon settings

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Run Network Diagnostic and Fix

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x fix-network-connectivity.sh

# Run the diagnostic and fix script
./fix-network-connectivity.sh
```

This script will:
- Test your current network connectivity
- Identify any DNS or connectivity issues
- Automatically fix common network problems
- Configure Docker for better network handling
- Test that Docker builds work properly

### Step 2: Run Network-Resilient Deployment

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x deploy-with-network-fallback.sh

# Run the network-resilient deployment
./deploy-with-network-fallback.sh
```

This script will:
- Test network connectivity before building
- Create network-resilient Dockerfiles
- Build images with retry logic and multiple DNS servers
- Deploy the application with enhanced network configuration

## Technical Details

### Network Resilience Features

#### 1. Multiple DNS Servers
```bash
# Configured in containers
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
```

#### 2. Package Installation Retry Logic
```bash
# Retry logic with exponential backoff
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Package installation attempt $i/5"
  if apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends "$@"; then
    echo "Package installation successful"
    break
  elif [ $i -lt 5 ]; then
    echo "Package installation failed, retrying in $((i * 10)) seconds..."
    sleep $((i * 10))
  else
    echo "All package installation attempts failed"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

#### 3. Enhanced npm Configuration
```bash
npm config set fetch-retry-mintimeout 10000
npm config set fetch-retry-maxtimeout 60000
npm config set fetch-retries 5
npm config set fetch-retry-factor 2
npm config set fetch-timeout 60000
```

#### 4. Docker Daemon Optimization
```json
{
  "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4", "1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"],
  "dns-opts": ["timeout:2", "attempts:3", "rotate", "single-request-reopen"]
}
```

### Generated Files

The solution creates several new files:

1. **`deploy-with-network-fallback.sh`** - Main deployment script with network resilience
2. **`fix-network-connectivity.sh`** - Network diagnostic and fix script
3. **`backend/Dockerfile.network-resilient`** - Enhanced backend Dockerfile
4. **`Dockerfile.frontend.network-resilient`** - Enhanced frontend Dockerfile
5. **`admin/Dockerfile.network-resilient`** - Enhanced admin Dockerfile
6. **`docker-compose.network-resilient.yml`** - Network-optimized compose file

## Troubleshooting

### If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check network connectivity manually:**
   ```bash
   ping 8.8.8.8
   nslookup deb.debian.org
   curl -I http://deb.debian.org
   ```

2. **Check Docker daemon status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status docker
   docker info
   ```

3. **Check system DNS configuration:**
   ```bash
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   systemctl status systemd-resolved
   ```

4. **Try building a simple test container:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm alpine:latest ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Temporary failure resolving 'deb.debian.org'"
**Solution**: Run `./fix-network-connectivity.sh` to configure multiple DNS servers

#### Issue: "Package installation failed"
**Solution**: The retry logic should handle this automatically, but you can increase retry attempts in the Dockerfiles

#### Issue: "Docker daemon not responding"
**Solution**: Restart Docker daemon: `sudo systemctl restart docker`

#### Issue: "Network connectivity test failed"
**Solution**: Check your internet connection and firewall settings

## Performance Impact

The network resilience features add minimal overhead:

- **Build Time**: ~10-30 seconds additional time due to retry logic
- **Container Size**: No significant increase
- **Runtime Performance**: No impact on application performance
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal increase due to additional DNS servers

## Security Considerations

- Uses public DNS servers (Google, Cloudflare) - ensure this is acceptable for your environment
- DNS queries are not encrypted (standard DNS)
- Consider using DoH (DNS over HTTPS) for enhanced security if needed

## Monitoring and Logs

The scripts provide detailed logging:

- Network connectivity test results
- DNS resolution status
- Package installation attempts and results
- Docker build progress
- Service health checks

Check the output for any warnings or errors during deployment.

## Fallback Options

If the network-resilient deployment still fails:

1. **Use cached builds**: The script attempts to use Docker layer caching
2. **Manual package installation**: Install packages manually in containers
3. **Offline deployment**: Use pre-built images or offline package repositories
4. **Alternative base images**: Use different base images that may have better connectivity

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Run the diagnostic script and share the output
2. Check your network infrastructure and firewall settings
3. Consider using a different network or VPN
4. Contact your system administrator for network configuration issues

**Note**: This solution is designed to handle common network connectivity issues during Docker builds. For enterprise environments with strict network policies, additional configuration may be required.
